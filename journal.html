		<p> Hi, here is my experience of 3rd day of Salesforce Training</p>

			<li> We learned and practiced on various scenarios where relationship fields proved to be very useful for systematic displaying of data </li>
			<li> We also learned about Validation Rules which are absolutely amazing to set some criteria for each scenario.</li>
	    		<li> It is fascinating to see there is no extent to which we can customize salesforce according to our requirements. </li>
			<li> We will be covering more scenarios in one upcoming holiday as they are given in our assignment. </li>

			<li> Hopefully, we will make most out of this Salesforce Training. </li>
