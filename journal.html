    <h5 class="card-title">Salesforce Training - 3rd March 2022</h5>
    <p class="card-text"> Hi, Here is my experience of 5th day of Salesforce Training</p>
    			<li> First of all, we started with Flow Builder. We made screen flow on various scenarios. </li>
			<li> And then we got to know about different types of flows like Autolaunched Flow, Schedule Triggered Flow and Record Triggered Flow. </li>
			<li> We got understanding of why Autolaunched flow is not used as much as earlier, because it cant be triggered automatically and had to trigger it from Process builder.</li>
	    		<li> So we use Record trigger flow in that case ,more often. </li>
			<li> We also learned about approval process and different aspects of it. </li>
			<li> We did a deep dive learning of Data security in salesforce. </li>
			<li> Learned about org-level, object-level and field level security. And one requires to pay extra attention to fully utilise all the security options available in Salesforce. </li>
	  		<li> We did lot of examples on real time users in an org to see how the security setting works and gives data integrity.</li>
	  		<li> Now, we need to complete our assignment and attempt lots of questions and submit it by today! </li>

    <p class="card-text"> Hi, Here is my experience of 4th day of Salesforce Training</p>
    			<li> Today, we have learned about lot of utilities like Page Layouts, Compact Layout, Cloning profiles, workflow rules and Process Builder. </li>
			<li> Though, Flows are the future of Automation process, but we have stated with Workflow and process builder today to understand about their benefits. </li>
			<li> The major difference between the two is, Process builder is more visually represented with each of its steps.</li>
	    		<li> And we can have wide range of actions and utilities with Process Builder. </li>
			<li> Also, we are being given 2 days of assignment today as our trainer Ankita couldn't upload 3rd day of assignment earlier. </li>
			<li> So, we will complete both 3rd day and 4th day's assignment by today. </li>
			<li> Though, Ankita ma'am has given some relaxation with today's assignment as to complete it in 2 parts. </li>
