    <h5 class="card-title">Java and ANT Training - 14th March 2022</h5>
    <p class="card-text"> Hi, Here is my experience of 1st day of Java Training</p>
    			<li> Today we have downloaded open jdk file given by Ghanshyam Sir! </li>
			<li> Then we went on to install it. </li>
			<li> We also downloaded apache ant in our system. As we are going use it in SFDC DevOps. </li>
	    	<li> Then we checked it by writing java -version in cmd but it showed an error initially. </li>
			<li> So we had to configure the environment variables in our system and give correct paths of java files. </li>
			<li> We learned about Java_HOME, ANT_HOME, echo %JAVA_HOME% and echo %ANT_HOME% commands and their relevance. 
			<li> After successfully getting result on cmd, we wrote one program in Java of "Hello World" and printed it on CMD itself.   </li>
			<li> Afterwards, we wrote one calculator program in java in which we just have to input 2 numbers through command line arguments. </li>
	  		<li> I learned lot of new things while working on Java. </li>
	  		<li> And looking forward to learn more in upcoming classes! </li>
	  		<li> Thank you for reading! </li>
